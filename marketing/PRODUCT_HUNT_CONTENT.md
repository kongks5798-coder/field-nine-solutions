## 4. First Comment (Maker's Comment)

```markdown
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm the founder of K-Universal, and I built this because I was frustrated watching my foreign friends struggle in Korea.

They'd ask me: "How do I call a taxi?" "Why won't this app accept my card?" "What does this menu say?"

Korea has amazing apps - but they're all in Korean, require Korean phone numbers, and don't accept foreign cards.

K-Universal changes that. One download, one account, and you have access to everything Korea offers.

We're launching with:
✅ Virtual payment card (works at 99% of Korean merchants)
✅ Taxi booking
✅ Food delivery
✅ Hotel reservations
✅ eSIM data plans
✅ Real-time translation

Coming soon:
🔜 KTX train booking
🔜 Concert & event tickets
🔜 Airport services

I'd love your feedback! What features would make YOUR Korea trip easier?

감사합니다! (Thank you!)
