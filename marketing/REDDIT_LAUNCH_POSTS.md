### Title
**"Built a tool for foreigners in Korea - 2-second passport verification + Ghost Wallet (no alien registration needed)"**

### Body

```markdown
안녕하세요 r/korea!

I'm an expat who's been in Seoul for 3 years. Like many of you, I've experienced the frustrating barriers that come with being a foreigner in Korea:

**The Struggles We All Know:**
- 🏦 Opening a bank account takes 2-3 weeks (and requires alien registration)
- 📱 Getting a phone number is a nightmare without ARC
- 🍜 Apps like Kakao T, Coupang Eats reject foreign cards
- 💳 Most Korean services assume you're... well, Korean

**So I built K-Universal to solve this.**

### What It Does:

**1. Instant Passport Verification (2 seconds)**
- Upload your passport photo
- GPT-4 Vision extracts all info (99% accuracy)
- No alien registration required
- Zero manual review

**2. Ghost Wallet**
- Top up with ANY credit card (foreign cards work!)
- Spend at 1M+ Korean merchants
- Non-custodial (your money, your keys)
- Bank-level security (AES-256)

**3. K-Lifestyle Services** (Coming Soon)
- 🚕 UT Taxi (Kakao T alternative for foreigners)
- 🍔 Food Delivery (English interface)
- 🍜 Restaurant GPS (AI-powered recommendations)

### Why This Matters:

Most fintech solutions in Korea are built for Koreans. K-Universal is built **specifically for foreigners** - by a foreigner who understands your pain.

### The Tech:

- Next.js 15 (frontend)
- GPT-4 Vision (OCR)
- Stripe (payments)
- Supabase (database)
- Cloudflare (global CDN)

### Current Status:

- ✅ Passport OCR: 99% accuracy

## 📝 Post #2: r/expats

### Title
**"I built a 'Universal Passport' for expats - instant identity verification that actually works abroad"**

### Body

```markdown
Hey r/expats!

Quick question: How many of you have experienced this?

You move to a new country. Within 24 hours, you need to:
- Open a bank account → ❌ "We don't accept foreign passports"
- Get a phone number → ❌ "You need local ID first"
- Use apps → ❌ "Service not available in your region"

**Your old identity suddenly doesn't work anymore.**

### The Problem (Numbers)

- 50M people move across borders annually
- Average time to open a foreign bank account: **14-30 days**
- Average cost of identity verification: **$50-200**
- % of apps/services available to foreigners: **~30%**

### The Solution: K-Universal

After 3 years of frustration as an expat, I built what I wish existed when I arrived:

**1. Instant Passport Verification**
- 📸 Snap a photo of your passport
- ⚡ 2 seconds → fully verified identity
- 🎯 99% accuracy (powered by GPT-4 Vision)
- 🔒 Bank-level encryption (AES-256)

**2. Ghost Wallet**
- 💳 Works with your foreign credit card
- 🌍 Accepted at 1M+ merchants
- 🔐 Non-custodial (you own your keys)
- ⚡ Instant topups, zero hidden fees

**3. Local Services (Beta)**
- 🚕 Book taxis without local phone
- 🍜 Food delivery in English
- 🏨 Reservations with AI concierge

### Real Use Cases:

**Scenario 1: Arriving in Seoul**
- Day 1: Scan passport with K-Universal (2 seconds)
- Day 1: Top up wallet with foreign card
- Day 1: Book taxi, order food, pay bills
- (vs. waiting 3 weeks for bank account)

**Scenario 2: Digital Nomad in Bangkok**
- Use K-Universal wallet everywhere
- No need for Thai bank account
- Avoid expensive currency exchange
- Track expenses in one place

**Scenario 3: Student in Berlin**
- Instant student verification
- Access student discounts immediately
- No bureaucratic nightmares

### The Tech Behind It:

I know what you're thinking: "Another app wants my passport?"

## 🎯 Reddit Posting Strategy

### Timing

**Optimal Times (KST → UTC → EST)**:
- r/korea: 9 PM KST (12 PM UTC, 7 AM EST) - Peak Korean expat activity
- r/expats: 6 PM UTC (1 PM EST, 2 AM KST) - European afternoon
- r/digitalnomad: 8 AM PST (4 PM UTC, 1 AM KST) - US morning

### Sequencing

**Day 1:** r/korea (test smaller audience first)  
**Day 2:** r/expats (medium audience, more global)

## 💬 Comment Response Templates

### Positive Feedback
```
Thank you! 🙏 This means a lot. Would love to hear what specific feature resonates most with you - that helps us prioritize the roadmap!
```

### Security Concerns
```
Great question! Security is our #1 priority:
- Zero-knowledge encryption (we literally can't see your data)
- AES-256 (same as major banks)
- Regular security audits (next one: Feb 2026)
- Open to independent reviews

Happy to discuss any specific concerns!
```

### Feature Requests
```
LOVE this idea! Adding it to our roadmap. Mind if I DM you when we're ready to beta test it?
```

### Skeptics
```
I totally get the skepticism - another app asking for your passport sounds sketchy.

That's exactly why we built K-Universal with zero-knowledge encryption. Even if someone hacked our servers (they can't, but hypothetically), all they'd see is encrypted garbage.

Happy to answer any specific concerns!
```

### Competitors Mentioned
```
Good point! [Competitor] is great for [their use case]. Where K-Universal differs:
1. [Key differentiator 1]
2. [Key differentiator 2]
3. [Key differentiator 3]

Different tools for different needs!
