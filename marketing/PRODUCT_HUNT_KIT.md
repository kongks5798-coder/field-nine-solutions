## 💬 Product Hunt Comments (Founder Story)

### Opening Comment

Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Your Name], founder of K-Universal.

**Why I built this:**

Three years ago, I moved to Seoul as an expat. On day 1, I tried to:
- Open a bank account → Rejected (foreign passport)
- Get a phone number → Required alien registration (3 weeks wait)
- Order food → No English menu, payment failed

I realized: **Your identity doesn't travel with you.**

So I built K-Universal - the first universal identity platform for the 50M people who move across borders every year.

**What makes us different:**
- 🛂 99% accurate passport OCR (GPT-4 Vision)
- 👻 Non-custodial wallet (your keys, your money)
- 🌏 Works in Korea today, everywhere tomorrow

We're live at https://fieldnine.io - would love your feedback!

## 💬 Sample Replies to Common Questions

### "How is this different from Stripe Identity?"

Great question! Stripe Identity is B2B (businesses verify customers). K-Universal is B2C (individuals own their verified identity).

Key differences:
- **You own your data** (we use zero-knowledge encryption)
- **Instant verification** (2s vs Stripe's 30s+)
- **Built-in wallet** (spend money immediately)
- **Lifestyle services** (taxi, food, travel)

Think of us as "Stripe Identity + Wallet + Concierge" for consumers.

### "What about privacy?"

We take privacy SERIOUSLY:
- 🔒 AES-256 encryption for all passport data
- 🔐 Zero-knowledge architecture (we can't see your keys)
- 🏦 Bank-level security audits
- ✅ GDPR + CCPA compliant

Your data = Your control.

### "Why focus on Korea first?"

Korea is the PERFECT test market:
- 2.5M expats (huge demand)
- #1 digital infrastructure globally
- Strict KYC requirements (pain point)
- English-speaking expat community (early adopters)

Once we prove it here, we expand to Japan, Singapore, Dubai, etc.

### "How do you make money?"

**Current**: 100% free (beta)

**Future revenue streams**:
1. Transaction fees (1% on wallet topups)
2. Premium features ($9.99/month)
   - Priority verification
   - Higher wallet limits
   - Premium lifestyle services
3. B2B licensing (banks, fintechs)
