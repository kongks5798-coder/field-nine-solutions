### Thread Version (1/5)
```
🧵 Why we built K-Universal:

1/ Traveling Korea is amazing. But using Korean apps? Nightmare.

Kakao Taxi needs a Korean phone.
Naver Pay needs a Korean bank.
Coupang needs a Korean address.

We fixed that. 👇
```

```
2/ K-Universal = One app for everything Korea

✅ Call taxis (Kakao integrated)
✅ Order food (English menus)
✅ Book hotels (best prices)
✅ Get eSIM (instant data)
✅ Pay anywhere (virtual card)

All without a Korean phone number.
```

```
3/ The secret? We partnered with Korean services to give foreigners access.

- Virtual payment card works at 99% of merchants
- Real-time translation for menus & signs
- 24/7 English support

It's like having a Korean friend in your pocket.
```

```
4/ We're live on Product Hunt today!

Would love your support 🙏

### Launch Announcement
```
Excited to share: K-Universal is now LIVE! 🎉

After months of development, we're launching the super app that makes Korea accessible to the world.

The Problem:
Korea has world-class apps for everything - taxi, food, payments, hotels. But they all require Korean phone numbers, Korean bank accounts, and Korean language skills.

50M+ tourists visit Korea yearly. Most can't use a single local app.

The Solution:
K-Universal consolidates 10+ essential Korean services into ONE English-friendly app:

🚕 Taxi (Kakao Taxi integrated)
🍜 Food delivery & restaurants
🏨 Hotels & accommodations
💳 Virtual payment card
🎫 Experiences & tours
📱 eSIM data plans

No Korean phone. No Korean bank. No Korean skills.

We're live on Product Hunt today, and I'd love your support!

### Founder Story
```
Why I built K-Universal:

Last year, I watched my American friend struggle for 30 minutes to call a taxi at Incheon Airport.

He had:
- Uber (doesn't work in Korea)
- Cash (taxi didn't accept)
- Google Translate (couldn't pronounce the address)

I called the taxi for him in 10 seconds using Kakao.

That moment stuck with me.

Korea has incredible infrastructure. But it's locked behind language and verification barriers.

So we built K-Universal.

One app. Everything Korea. English-first.

Today, we launched on Product Hunt. Would mean the world if you could check it out.

Title: Made an app for foreigners to access Korean services (taxi, food, payments) - looking for feedback

Hey r/korea!

I've been working on K-Universal - basically a super app that lets foreigners access Korean services without needing a Korean phone number or bank account.

Features:
- Taxi booking (same cars as Kakao Taxi)
- Food delivery with translated menus
- Virtual payment card (works at most Korean merchants)
- Hotel booking
- eSIM data plans

We just launched and I'd love feedback from the community. What services would be most useful for foreigners living in or visiting Korea?

Title: Built a super app for digital nomads in Korea - no Korean phone/bank needed

For those who've been to Korea: you know the struggle. Amazing country, but all the good apps (Kakao Taxi, food delivery, etc.) need Korean verification.

I built K-Universal to solve this:
- Virtual payment card (instant, works everywhere)
- Taxi booking
- Food delivery (English menus!)
- Hotels
- eSIM

Just launched on Product Hunt. Would love feedback from fellow nomads!
